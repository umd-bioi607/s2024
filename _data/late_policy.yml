policies:
  - The late penalty for assignments is 1% per hour late up to a maximum of 48 hours.
  - The points are deducted in integer amounts and rounded down (i.e. 59 minutes late is a 0% penalty).
  - You are allowed 1 "free" late submission (up to 48 hours) over the course of all assignments. 
  - When you apply your "free" late pass, you will not lose any additional points for late turn in of that assignment.
  - You must specify that you are using your "free" late pass when you submit your assignment (e-mail both the TA and me).
  - Your use of the "free" late is a one-time, irrevocable decision (you can't switch which project you apply it to).
